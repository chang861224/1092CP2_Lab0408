Rubia

Lyrics by TetraCalyx
Music & Producer by Zoe

Life blooms like a flower
Far away or by the road
Waiting for the one
To find the way back home

Rain falls a thousand times
No footprints of come-and-go
You who once went by
Where will you belong

I feel your sigh and breath
In the last blow of wind
Not yet for the story on the last page
It's not the end

Life blooms like a flower
Far away or by the road
Waiting for the one
To find the way back home

Time flows across the world
There is always a longer way to go
Till I reach your arms
A Madder there for you

Up against the stream
Waterways will join as one
Tracing to the source
No more strayed or lost

You will see petals fly
When lament becomes carol
Could you please hear my voice
That hungers for a duo

Life blooms like a flower
Far away or by the road
Waiting for the one
To find the way back home

Time flows across the world
There is always a longer way to go
Till I reach your arms
A Madder there for you

Life blooms like a flower
Far away or by the road
Waiting for the one
To find the way back home

Time flows across the world
There is always a longer way to go
Till I reach your arms
A Madder there for you
