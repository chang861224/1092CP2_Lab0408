You're my painkiller
When my brain gets bitter
You keep me close
You keep me close
I got front row seats for the park side livin'
Feel like the one but I'm one in a billion
Teenage cynical and I don't really know
What's the point of living if my heart gets broken?
Driving on the road, waiting for head-on collision
Springtime funeral, I miss you but I'd rather be alone
To keep me from
Heartbreaks, headaches
The doctor says I'm diagnosed with
Shit days, mistakes
But I'll be fine
But I'll be fine
'Cause you're my painkiller
When my brain gets bitter
You keep me close
When I've been miserable
And it takes forever
To let my brain get better
You keep me close
You keep me close
Window seats as the plane starts to leavin'
Miss those streets where my knees were bleedin'
Homesick veteran
I left my bed again
Oh, looking for
Heartbreaks, headaches
The doctor says I'm diagnosed with
Shit days, mistakes
But I'll be fine
But I'll be fine
'Cause you're my painkiller
When my brain gets bitter
You keep me close
When I've been miserable
And it takes forever
To let my brain get better
You keep me close
You keep me close
Please, never leave me
'Cause I'm barely holdin' on
You give me a reason to keep on breathin'
'Cause you're my painkiller
When my brain gets bitter
You keep me close
When I've been miserable
And it takes forever
To let my brain get better
You keep me close
You keep me close
I know you hear me (Close)
Yeah (Close)
Close
