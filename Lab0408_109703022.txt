Sanctuary

Lyricist: Kaka
Composer: Yang Jionghan

Oh Girl
Helpless and afraid
Standing all alone as you went away
Raindrops on my face
Blurring my illusion of the choices I could make
Hard enough to put myself together

Oh Girl
Don't you be afraid
I said to myself as I looked away
Raindrops on my face
Washing off my silly little wish to hide away
I am strong enough to make it through the rain

When I close my eyes
Everything will be alright
Everything you said I'll keep in mind
The rain will stop the sun will shine

If you're by my side
Everything will be alright
Thinking of your tender lullabies
You've built an inner sanctuary I can hide
You are the secret sanctuary I live by

When I close my eyes
Everything will be alright
Everything you said I'll keep in mind
I'm waiting for the morning light

You still by my side
Everything will be alright
Thinking of your tender lullabies
You've built an inner sanctuary I can hide
You are the secret sanctuary I live by
You are my secret sanctuary tonight
