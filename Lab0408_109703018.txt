Hero written by and composed by Mariah Carey and Walter Afanasieff

There's a hero
If you look inside your heart
You don't have to be afraid of what you are
There's an answer If you reach into your soul
And the sorrow that you know will melt away

And then a hero comes alone
With the strength to carry on
And you cast your fears aside
And you know you can survive
So when you feel like hope is gone
Look inside you and be strong
And you'll finally see the truth
That a hero lies in you

It's a long road
When you face the world alone
No one reaches out a hand for you to hold
You can find love if you search within yourself
And the emptiness you felt will disappear

Lord knows dreams are hard to follow
But don't let anyone tear them away
Hold on, there will be tomorrow
In time, you'll find the way
