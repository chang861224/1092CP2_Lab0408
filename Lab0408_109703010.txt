Gin Wigmore(Song writer & Singer)
Written In the Water

I'd be fine if I met you
and you'd have left you're own
Give me one kiss for the road boy
Now it's time I let you go

I will run to the river
I will reach for the well
drown my sorrows in someone
In the hope I leave this hell

I can't live for forgiveness
I can't live the lie
I won't be what you wanted
I won't be what you like

Yeah, it's written in the water
Yeah, it's everywhere I go;
Telling that I should leave you
Like I did two times ago

I'd be fine if I met you
and you'd have left you're own
Give me one kiss for the road boy
Now it's time I let you go
